1. Objectives

The main objectives are:
• To try some new common Windows Forms controls.
• To learn to use he List<T> collection for storing a list of objects.
• To exercise with Properties, constructors and chain-calling of constructors.

2. Description

Write a Windows Form Application that saves a list of items. 

Every item has the following data:

Description
Amount
Unit
An example: “Buy milk 2 gallons”. “Buy milk” is saved as description, 2 as amount and gallons as unit.

The basic requirement is that GUI should allow the user to add a new item, but for a grade A, the user should also be able to
change or delete an existing item. The GUI should also present a list of all items saved in the registry. The list is to be updated
after every change in the registry.
